### [Bringing Time Back to the Web (Or: The Struggle for Depth)](http://continuations.com/post/18605081084/bringing-time-back-to-the-web-or-the-struggle-for "Source")
*by [Albert Wenger](https://twitter.com/#!/albertwenger) - February 29, 2012*

* There is so much new content on the Web every day that one can barely
  keep up with it
* It is becoming ever harder to delve into the past, a problem
  aggravated by Google's recent tilt of their search algorithm towards
recency
* We need to surface time explicitly. For example, imagine a version of
  Techmeme where you can see the historical precedents of any post, or a
search engine that allows you to "scroll" into the past of any result




### [Raspberry Pi Mini Computer Served Up For $35](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/29/raspberry-pi_n_1310441.html "Source")
*by [Courteney Palis, Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/courteney-palis) - February 29, 2012*


*Palis describes the $35-a-piece Raspberry PI micro-computer and the
implications for the teaching of computer science*

* **The Raspberry Pi device**
  * A complete computer for $35
  * Credit-card sized
  * "Last-decade" hardware (700 Mhz processor, 256 MB RAM) that's still
enough to run Linux, code, browse the internet and even play games such
as Quake 3 !

* **What this means**
  * Programming can be learned by almost anyone
  * People in poor areas, children in poor schools get access to technology
  * Like the Kinect, the Raspberry Pi will enable hackers to build ever
more impressive prototypes. The possibilities are endless



### [Fred Wilson on the Raspberry Pi](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/03/raspberry-pi.html "Source")
*by [@fredwilson](https://twitter.com/#!/fredwilson) - March 1, 2012*


*Fred Wilson explains why he thinks the Raspberry Pi is a game changer*

* Hardware that's currently expensive (phones and especially tablets)
is going to be cheaper and cheaper. We will see sub $100 tablets in 3 to
5 years
* The Raspberry Pi's goal is, according to the developper, to entice
children to learn to code. But all markets that can be end-to-end
digital, not just education, will be disrupted
