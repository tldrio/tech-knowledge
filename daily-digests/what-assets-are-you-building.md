If you are building a consumer internet startup, you need to think about the assets that you are building and how these fit with your scaling and fundraising strategies.

* **Number of users**
  * Most difficult to execute and scale because the lifetime value of a user is typically very low
  * Needs low customer acquisition cost, high retention, high conversion, tremendous growth, a lot of financing runway until the sheer number of users can generate huge revenues via advertising or traffic generation 
* **High lifetime value**
  * No need for a lot of users, because you make a lot of money of them.
  * Rarely needs mass financing because they are cash cows
  * Can invest heavily in marketing
* **Massive data**
  * Sometimes (twitter,instagram) the data inputted by the users is more important than the users
  * Free services to the user in order to leverage the data at scale
  * Usually requires a lot of financing until monetization is effective
* **A great platform**
  * Monetization comes from 3rd parties (think facebook/zynga)
  * Main asset is user engagement with your platform
  * Need to build the platform as well as the first services on top of it
  * Needs a lot of financing




### [Five New Management Metrics You Need To Know](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/12/13/five-new-management-metrics-you-need-to-know/2/ "Source")

Here is a list of 5 very important metrics that never appear in annual
reports. Most companies measure outputs but not inputs or throughput.

* **Flow State Percentage**
  * Interruptions move us out of flow state which is the state that
  enables the most productivity. 
  * It takes seconds to get out of but can
  take very long to get back in. 
  * Measure how uninterrupted your
  programmers are.
* **The Anxiety-Boredom Continuum**
  * People want to be challenged, but not to the point that they break
  down.
  * On the other hand, people will leave if they are bored.
  * Check in often with your employees to make sure you are striking the
  right balance
* **Meeting Promoter Score**
  * Meetings are very expensive and rarely productive
  * At the end of each meeting, ask each participant to rate it and
  suggest improvements
  * Usually requires a lot of financing until monetization is effective
* **Compound weekly learning rate**
  * The ability to learn is like compounding interest on an investment
  * Ask your team: how did you get 1% better this week?
  * Did you learn something valuable from our customers?
  * Did you make a change to the product that drove better results?
* **Positive Feedback ratio**
  * Catch people doing good things and tell them
  * This way when you provide feedback on areas to improve, they will
  really listen
