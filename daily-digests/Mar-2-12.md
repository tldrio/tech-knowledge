### [Habits Are The New Viral: Why Startups Must Be Behavior Experts](http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/02/habits-are-new-viral-why-startups-must.html "Source")
*by [@nireyal](https://twitter.com/#!/nireyal) - Feb 26, 2012*


*Nir Eyal describes the importance of habits besides virality for the
success of products in the Curated Web*

* Habits are what matters. Economic value of web businesses increasingly depends on the strength of the habitual behavior of their users
* From Web 1.0 where companies measured themselves on pages viewed and CPM rates, new (social) companies proved  to be valuable because being habit-forming (hot triggers, variable rewards, regular check-in...)
* At the dawn of the Curated Web, companies must build habit creation into their products and business models. Not only are users inundated by distractions, but acquiring users is also harder than ever before
* Companies, which successfully create user habits even without viral growth can build huge enterprises (Evernote, Amazon)
* The companies of the Curated Web have habit formation embedded in their DNA. This is because data collection is at the heart of any Curated Web business and to succeed, they must predict what users will think is most personally relevant
* The more the user engages with a Curated Web company, the more data the company has to tailor and improve the user’s experience. This self-improving feedback loop has the potential to be more useful – and more addictive — than anything we’ve seen before

*by [@JoshConstine](https://twitter.com/#!/joshconstine) - Feb 26, 2012*


*Josh Constine reports the move of Facebook Analytics Tool Insights to
Real Time and describes all the possibilities it will enable*

* Page performance data in (near) real-time rather than on average 48 hour delay
* Real-time data reporting in Insights could give businesses the understanding necessary to drive higher ROI
* Immediate “people talking about this” data could give marketers a sense of a post’s virality, and indicate if they should modify content or apps they link to
* “Insights API give Page owners an opportunity to see how their Page actually lives and breathes”.” It’s up to us as tool developers to turn that data into something awesome and present it in relevant actionable analytics.”

*by [@JordanKurzweil](https://twitter.com/#!/jordankurzweil) - Feb 25, 2012*


*Jordan Kurzweil describes the context of “digital magazination” of content. He states some recommendations to straighten up print business. At the heart of its reflexion is personalized and curated content*

* PRINT IS DEAD. year-over-year declines in revenue, subscriptions and circulation
* What can Old Print do to survive? Stop rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, grow a pair, and change your businesses:
    * Face reality of change (aging of audience, digital concurrency, new technology fragmenting audience...)
    * Start thinking like startups: deploy some of your profits to incubate new idea ( see Washington post personalized headlines)
    * Retool staff and cost structure: Everyone in your organization should be a doer, contributing 100 percent of her/his work hours to making things,  put editors imagination to work
    * Stop thinking technology serves content: Technology and content need to be seen as one and the same, each working with the other to delight and engage your users
    * Update web platforms 
    * Use data to inform your editorial and product decisions 
    * Break down the wall between editors, writers and readers
    * Consider your  content  as currency, not the end-all, be-all, but a means to an end
