### [Habits Are The New Viral: Why Startups Must Be Behavior Experts](http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/02/habits-are-new-viral-why-startups-must.html "Source")
*by [@nireyal](https://twitter.com/#!/nireyal) - Feb 26, 2012*


*Nir Eyal describes the importance of habits besides virality for the
success of products in the Curated Web*

* Habits are what matters. Web businesses success increasingly depends on the strength of their users' habitual behavior 
* Web 1.0 companies measured success by pageviews and CPM, whereas new (social) companies proved  to be valuable because they were habit-forming (hot triggers, variable rewards, regular check-in...)
* At the dawn of the Curated Web, companies must build habit creation into their products and business models. Not only are users inundated by distractions, but acquiring users is also harder than ever before
* Companies which successfully create user habits can build huge enterprises, even without viral growth (Evernote, Amazon)
* The more the user engages with a Curated Web company, the more data the company has to tailor and improve the user&rsquo;s experience. This self-improving feedback loop has the potential to be more useful &ndash; and more addictive &mdash; than anything we&rsquo;ve seen before

*Josh Constine reports the move of Facebook Analytics Tool Insights to
Real Time and describes all the possibilities it will enable*

* Page performance data in (near) real-time rather than on average 48 hour delay could enable businesses to reach higher ROIs
* Immediate &ldquo;people talking about this&rdquo; data could give marketers a sense of a post&rsquo;s virality, and indicate if they should modify the content or the apps they link to
* &ldquo;Insights API give Page owners an opportunity to see how their Page actually lives and breathes&rdquo;.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s up to us as tool developers to turn that data into something awesome and present it in relevant actionable analytics.&rdquo;

*by [@JordanKurzweil](https://twitter.com/#!/jordankurzweil) - Feb 25, 2012*


*Jordan Kurzweil describes the context of &ldquo;digital magazination&rdquo; of content. He states some recommendations to straighten up print business. At the heart of his reflexion is personalized and curated content*

* PRINT IS DEAD. revenue, subscriptions and circulation are declining
* What can Old Print do to survive? Stop rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, grow a pair, and change your business model:
    * Accept this evolution (aging and fragmentation of audience, concurrency from other digital media ...) and embrace it
    * Start thinking like startups: use some of your profits to incubate new ideas (e.g. Washington post personalized headlines)
    * Rethink your organization : everyone should be a doer, contributing 100 percent of her/his work hours to making things
    * Stop thinking that technology serves content: they are now one and the same, each working with the other to delight and engage your users
    * Update web platforms
    * Use data to inform your editorial and product decisions 
    * Break down the wall between editors, writers and readers
    * Consider your content as a currency, not the end-all be-all but a means to an end
