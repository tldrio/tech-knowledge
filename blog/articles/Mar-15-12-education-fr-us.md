Title: Why so Many French are not Entrepreneurs

_France's higher education trains one of the world's best academic
elite, but is home to very few successful start-ups. Having studied engineering in France and then at Stanford University, I will try to explains this apparent paradox._

#### Party hard, study a bit, get straight As
When I took my first classes at Stanford University, I was very
surprised by the difficulty level. My French friends and I found the material to be very straightforward, the assignments and exams were very easy and the grading more than forgiving. We would party a lot, study a bit, and still get close to 4.0 GPAs. Simply put, we thought we were on top of the (academic) world. Of course, we were wrong.

#### The hard reality
But then we took an entrepreneurship class ("hey, how hard can that
be ?"), and the professor asked us who had already created a company.
"What a joke, who can create a company at 22 ?" was the question that
crossed our minds. But three quarters of the class raised their hand,
and we realized that we were indeed not at the top of the world.

#### Hone your test-taking skills
If you are not French, you probably don't know anything about its arcane
higher education, and you can read [this PhD comic](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1292)
for a very good introduction. To sum it up, there is only one way to be part of the academic elite after high school, 
and it is to enter the _"prepa"_, a two years long very intensive cursus at the end of which you take a competitive exam and get into the best school
(_"grande ecole"_) your rank enables you to. Once you get into one of these, you are assured you will easily land 
one of the best/most well-paid jobs available.  

There are good points to this system. It teaches us rigor, hard
work, how to handle pressure and a lot about theoretical science. But what we learn
best is how to do well at tests. And since it is so hard,
people from this system are still very proud of their
achievement 20 years later.  

#### "I can do it!"
Basically in France, a lot of people believe that we can measure an
individual's skills by how well he fared in a test 20 years ago. We tend
to favorably view people with a perfect pedigree: the best school, and
then a job at an elite consulting or investment-banking firm. Trying to create a start-up but failing is
not well preceived at all.  

Americans are very different. They believe that you should use the most
recent achievements to judge a person's skills, and that if you try, you
can do it. Where many a Frenchman would not even try for fear of failing,
Americans will believe that success is inevitably down the road. And so
they try. And so they end up winning.

#### The best of both worlds
I don't think the French system is inherently bad. It produces very good engineers with a strong Math background that is useful to become a good coder. But it is time we stopped having this "everything is a test"
mentality, and understand that **failing is not necessarily a bad thing, if you seriously
tried**. Thinking like this would radically change the French start-up
ecosystem: not only would we have more entrepreneurs, but also less
risk-adverse investors, and more ambitious ideas.
