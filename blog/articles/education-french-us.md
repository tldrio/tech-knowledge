Title: Why so many French are NOT entrepreneurs

_France's higher education trains one of the world's best academic
elite, but is home to very few successful start-ups. A French student
who spent 18 months studying at Stanford University tries to explains this apparent paradox._

#### Party hard, study a bit, get straight As
When I took my first classes at Stanford University, I was very
surprised by the difficulty level. My French friends and I found the material to be very straightforward, the assignments and exams very easy and the grading more than forgiving. We would party a lot, study a bit, and still get 3.9-like GPAs. Simply put, we thought we were at the top of the world.

#### The hard reality
But then we took an entrepreneurship class (hey, how hard can **that**
be ?), and the professor asked us who had already created a company.
"What a joke, who can create a company at 22 ?" was the question that
crossed our minds. But three quarters of the class raised their hand,
and we realized that we were indeed not at the top of the world.

#### Hone your test-taking skills
If you are not French, you probably don't know anything about its arcane
higher education, and you can read [this PhD comic](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1292) for a very good introduction. To sum it up, there is only one way to be part of the academic elite after high school, and it is to enter the _"prepa"_, a two years very intensive cursus where we have to work 80-100 hours a week to learn an insane amount of maths and physics (if you are an engineer). The grading is very strict, and a 60% grade already puts you in the top 10% of your class. After two years, you take a competitive exam and get into the best school (_"grande ecole"_) your rank enables you to. Once you get into one of these, you are assured you will easily land one of the best/most well-paid jobs available.  

There are good points to this system. It teaches us rigor, hard
work, how to handle pressure and a lot about science. But what we learn
best is how to do well at tests.  And since the preparation is so hard,
people from this system are still very proud, 20 years on, of this
achievement.  

#### "I can do it !"
Basically in France, a lot of people believe that we can measure an
individual's skills by how well he fared in a test 20 years ago. We tend
to favorably view people with a perfect pedigree: the best school, and
then a jog at an elite firm. Trying to create a start-up but failing is
**not**  well seen.  

Americans are very different. They believe that you should use the most
recent achievements to judge a person's skills, and that if you try, you
can do it. Where many a French would not even try for fear of failing,
Americans will believe that success is inevitably down the road. And so
they try. And so they win.

#### The best of both worlds
I don't think the French system is inherently bad. We are usually very
good problem solversm and a strong Math background is useful to learn
how to code. It is time we stop having this "everything is a test"
attitude, and understand that **failing is not necessarily a bad thing, if you seriously
tried.** Thinking like this would radically change the French start-up
ecosystem: not only would we have more entrepreneurs, but also less
risk-adverse investors.
