## Synchronous communication? 

Synchronous communication is a face to face oral discussion. 
Synchronous because people talking do 
it at the same exact moment: ever tried answering your colleagues 
2 minutes or 1 hour after they questioned you? Impossible as
talking means direct and not delayed interaction.  
It has to be compared with asynchronous communication which 
relies on a written exchange.   

##What for?  

Oral conversation is **appropriate only for situations involving long
tirades, arguments, strong opinions to defend**: resolve a conflict, 
argue, deliberate...  
For other situations synchronous communication is 
counter-productive.  

## The pitfalls of synchronous communication at work   

For your everyday work conversations you should think twice
before having an oral discussion. Why? Here are **4 reasons**:  

* **Oral discussion = interruption** When somebody
  asks you something it drains all your attention. You have to switch your
  brain to provide the adequate answer which means lose all the
  concentration you had in your work. 
  The ten-seconds question becomes a ten-minutes perturbation, taking into
  account the time to refocus and recall what your were doing.  

* **It involves moving and/or shouting in the office**. Depending on
  your work office configuration talking with somebody means moving to his
  desk or shouting through the open space. In the former case it
  magnifies your work interruption. In the latter case your
  colleagues will be thankful not to miss a word of your private conversation.   

* **Conversation drifts definitely** Oral conversation drifts more than
  a bobsleigh on the ice. Have you never start a conversation speaking
  of the crucial decision you should take and end speaking of the last
  hilarious MIME you read?  

* **Exchange is lost for the posterity** Oral conversation is not actionable, for you
  and even more for your teammates. What if you need to recall all the points
  stated? How do you keep track of the history of your conversation?
  What if the following week you'll have the same question? 
  Won't you feel bad disturbing your colleagues again?  

Common sense recommends trying to **find the solution by yourself** 
before looking for help. But we know this is normal
asking for somebody's help instead of googling to find the appropriate
answer. In that case **go for asynchronous communication.**

In a later post I'll cover asynchronous communication
especially the pitfalls of emails and the benefits having a chat room
for your team.
