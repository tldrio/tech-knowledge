In a recent [post](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/12/13/five-new-management-metrics-you-need-to-know/ "Article"),
James Slavet (Greylock Partners) describes metrics we should consider to
be more productive. The top one is called Flow State Percentage and
measures the relative time we are deeply concentrated on what we are doing. Flow state has
an amazing impact on development cycles times. One big threat for  
flow state is synchronous communication.  

## Synchronous communication? 

Synchronous forms of communication include face to face conversation or phone
discussion. 
Synchronous because people talking do 
it at the same exact moment: ever tried answering your colleagues 
2 minutes or 1 hour after they asked you a question? That's impossible 
as oral conversations don't work with delay.
Asynchronous communication solves that problem  
by relies on a written exchange.   

##What for?  

Oral conversations are **only appropriate when a written exchange could take
much longer than it should**: conflict resolution, 
 detailed explanation of a topic, etc. 
  
For other situations synchronous communication is 
counter-productive.  

## The pitfalls of synchronous communication at work   

For your everyday work conversations you should think twice
before having an oral discussion. Why? Here are **4 reasons**:  

* **Oral discussion = interruption** When somebody
  asks you something it drains all your attention. You have to switch your
  focus to provide the adequate answer which means you lose all the
  concentration you had in your work. 
  The ten-seconds question becomes a ten-minutes perturbation, taking into
  account the time you need to refocus (if you even manage to refocus)
  and recall what your were doing.  

* **It involves moving and/or shouting in the office**. Depending on
  your work office configuration talking with somebody means moving to his
  desk or shouting through the open space. In the former case it
  magnifies your work interruption. In the latter case you'll manage
  to effectively disturb everyone of your coworkers.  

* **Fatally you drift** Oral conversations drift more than
  a bobsleigh on ice. Have you ever started a conversation about
  the crucial decision you should take and ended up speaking of the last
  hilarious meme you read?  

* **Exchanges are lost for the posterity** Oral conversations are not actionable, for you
  or your teammates. What if you need to recall all the points
  stated? How do you keep track of the history of your conversation?
  What if the following week you'll have the same question? 
  Won't you feel bad disturbing your colleagues again?  


Before engaging in any kind of communication there is one thing 
you should try: **find an answer by yourself**. 
But sometimes it's more efficient
to ask for somebody's help instead of googling to find the appropriate
answer. In that case **go for asynchronous communication.**

In a later post I'll cover asynchronous communication
especially the pitfalls of emails and the benefits of having a chat room
for your team.
