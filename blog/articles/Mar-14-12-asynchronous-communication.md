In a [recent article](http://needforair.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-synchronous-communicatio-70441 "recent article") 
I detailed why synchronous communication is not
appropriate for work: it leads to interruptions, it involves moving or
shouting, it drifts and it leaves no trace.  
To solve this communication problem I believe in the asynchronous way of
doing it.

## Asynchronous?  

WTF is this? Asynchronous means that things can occur not at the
time, with delay in between. In an asynchronous communication
interlocutors can exchange and continue their discussion
whenever they want it. Examples of
asynchronous communication medium are: letter, text message, email,
chat... They all share a common point: they are **written communication
mediums**.  

## Asynchronous means superior  

The massive use of text messages illustrates the **usefulness and the
advantages an asynchronous communication offers over an oral conversation.**
It's quick and efficient, you can respond hours later, you keep track of the history etc.

## Why Emails kill your productivity?  

People widely use emails to communicate at work. Emails are adapted for
internal communication like **reports, formal announcements**. For the
everyday use case they are counter productive. You end up receiving tons
of emails a day, **spending hours responding, deleting, archiving etc.**

## The right communication medium: the Chat Room  

Set up a chat room for your team is probably one of the most important
action you could do to improve its efficiency and productivity. 
90% of its communication should occur there. **You have all your
conversation, files and links history, you can create groups of discussions, 
the process to send a message is so much easier**! Aren't you bored
clicking *New Message*, filling recipients addresses? Even clicking on *Respond* 
is painful.  
You should use your chat room to communicate even if you work 
in the same room for the reasons I detailed in my
[previous post](http://needforair.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-synchronous-communicatio-70441 "Previous post").  

**Don't waste more time and set up your private chat room.** 
[HipChat](http://www.hipchat.com "HipChat") is a great tool for that.
