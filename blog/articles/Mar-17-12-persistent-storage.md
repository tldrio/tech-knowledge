Yesterday was my wife's grand father funeral. Those moments are intense
family time where everybody gather and talk all the anecdotes they
recall. The best place to dig the past is the attic. That's where my
wife found family photographic slides.

Those slides were from 35 to 50 years old. My wife and I were skeptical
about the state of the slides, could we get something out of them?
Definitely. They were in perfect state and I'm sure they still will be in 50
more years.  Thanks to the slide projector
that still worked perfectly too we set up the screening room in the
living space. We spent hours and hours viewing 15 years of photos,
laughing at everybody that looked so young, trying to identify people we
had forgotten, remembering good moments spent together. Despite the 
circumstances everybody had a great time and forgot its sadness for a
while.  

This episode made me think that today people store their thousands of
photos they take a year on DVDs, hard drives. Who developed its last
holidays photos? Not me for sure. But those new technology materials 
make false advertising. They don't last. 10 to 15 years maximum under
optimal conditions. And at the current pace we won't find an optical
disk reader in 15 years.  

That's why I was wondering if our grand children will live such recall
moments. They won't find any usable DVDs nor our Dropbox password in
the attic. What will be the physical media storage support of our generation 
that will allow our grand children to dive into our memories?
