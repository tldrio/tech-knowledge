Yesterday was my wife's grand father funeral. Those moments are intense
family time where everybody gathers together and tells all the anecdotes they
have. The best place to dig into the past is the attic. That's where my
wife found family photographic slides.

Those slides were from 35 to 50 years old. My wife and I were skeptical
about the state of the slides, could we get something out of them?
Definitely. They were in perfect state and I'm sure they will still be 50
years from now.  In the living room, we set up the slide projector which was still in great shape
as well. We spent hours and hours viewing 15 years of photos,
laughing at everybody that looked so young, trying to identify people we
had forgotten, remembering good moments spent together. Despite the 
circumstances everyone had a great time and forgot one's sadness for a
while.  

This episode made me think that today people store their thousands of
photos they take a year on DVDs, hard drives and the cloud. Do you know anyone who has developed their last
holidays photos? I know I haven't. Those new technologies 
make for false advertising. They don't last more than 10 to 15 years maximum under
optimal conditions. And at the current pace we won't find an optical
disk reader in 15 years.  

That's why I was wondering if our grand children will live such
moments. They won't find any usable DVDs nor our Dropbox password in
the attic. What will be the physical media storage support of our generation 
that will allow our grandchildren to dive into our memories?
