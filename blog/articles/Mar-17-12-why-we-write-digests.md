All three of us read a lot. Blogs, [Hacker
News](http://news.ycombinator.com "Hacker News"), links we get through
Twitter, etc. This is a good thing because we stay informed. However the
more important question is: do we learn anything valuable? Do we
actually memorize the gist of all that content we are reading? Spending
so much time reading would be a huge waste if it wasn't consolidated in
some fashion. That's why we decided to write summaries of the best
articles we find.

## It forces you to really understand what the article is about

My Math and Physics professors would always say that the best way to learn 
was to get to the point where you are able to 
recap in writing the course materials (theroems, proofs, case studies).

In order to select the most critical parts of an article you need to
really read through the whole article and pick up the signal that you
want to remember. This means you should understand thoroughly what the
article is about and the author's reasoning. Why she spent time on some
subject and not on others. 

When writing up a summary, be it by mere copy/pasting or rephrasing, you put yourself
in an active cognitive process. You are not simply consuming
anymore, you are disecting and structuring information. Not only will
your memory be more deeply impressed than if you just read but it will
be more structured adn organized.
