*In a nutshell...* Have you never been on the lookout for this expression 
while reading an article? The fact is that we are all fond of digested
information. With Internet and social medias the quantity of information
we have access to has become huge; we can even say we are coping with an 
[information overload problem](http://needforair.com/information-overload-and-how-to-keep-up-with-5849 "Overload"). 
We can potentially be aware of all what is going on everywhere, instantaneously 
and regarding any topic. **Digested information is growing into a 
wanted resource **in this context.

## Success of digested information  

Many recent startups have been able to leverage these expectations to
succeed. [Franbridge](http://www.fanbridge.com/ "Fanbridge") with its 
[Social digest](http://www.fanbridge.com/blog/introducing-social-digest "Social Digest") 
will soon [reach 10 millions subscribers](http://pandodaily.com/2012/03/21/as-it-turns-out-fanbridges-most-exciting-product-is-boring-old-email/)!  
We can even see Twitter's success as the success of short and digested
information. The timeline is **an infinite bullet points list of valuable and
summarized information.**  
Aggregators and curators serve the same ideal: centralize and filter the
information. These products offer the ability to catch up with a large
variety of information. They trully meet the need for staying up to
date. It's not us who go to the information anymore but information that goes to
us ready to be consumed.

## Social pressure  

In this era of live information there is an enormous pressure of missing the big news. 
*What? How did you miss Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston breakup?* We
don't want to be left aside so we have to keep up. **Social pressure keeps
our thirst for information going.** There is likewise this urge to be
the first to spread the news. Information access has to be quick and
efficient. 

## Time is not extensible  

Even if we'd love to we can't spend our day reading the news, blogposts,
articles. We can only spare some limited time for reading information.
That's why we like short, centralized, easily accessible information.
Facing the huge pile of information we need to be able to know which one
will be interesting to dig into. That's what we are doing when we are scanning the
headlines of a newspaper or newswebsite. The level of detail 
between the full text and the title alone, the summary, is very important. 
**It helps us to form an idea of what the article is about.**  

*[En Bref](http://www.canalplus.fr/c-divertissement/pid3848-c-bref.html "Bref")* 
we face such an important quantity of information that we have to form 
an overall picture of each resource to decide to go or not into the details.
That's what digests and summaries are for.
