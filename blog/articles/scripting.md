When working on a project we always face repetitive tasks. But we shouldn't have to spend as much time for those tasks as we usually do. We love
to think: "I just have to do it once and I won't have to do it again" But we never have to do it only once, be it for the current project or
for a later one.    

Task repetition can be done in a painless way: the solution is scripting. All the automatable work we
don't reuse is wasted time. Instead
we should always see mechanical tasks as potential scripts. It's only
because we tend to procrastinate and we don't face this reality that we
postpone the moment we start scripting.  

I think scripting is a very important activity, above
all because it makes us spare a lot of time. The inputs changed? No matter, just
rerun the script and we are done.  

I love scripting because a script is something concrete and useful. By writing our custom
script we *"Scratch our own itch"*, we solve our own problem with our
own technical skills, which always provides an immense satisfaction. Coding a script is like shipping a
small product !  

In addition, it helps us develop and extend our programming
skills. It improves our knowledge of the scripting language and it makes us
discover API wrappers.  

When working in a team, scripting is even more useful. It's
more than likely that our teamates will have to do later whar we are doing now. On top of that, scripting for a team forces us
to write good quality code because our users are our teammates. They
won't be as indulgent as we are regarding our work, we don't want them
to think that we are poor coders, so we do it right.  


The next time you think "it would be so nice to automate this work", spend some time to look for a scripting solution ! The more you script the better you will become at it. So take some time thinking about what you are doing, you will see
how it improves your creativity and your productivity.
