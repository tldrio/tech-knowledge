Stop procrastinating, start scripting

When working on a project we always face repetitive parts. But we don't have to spend as much time for those tasks as we usually do. We love
thinking: "I just have to do it once and then I'm
done." But we never have to do it once, be it for the same project or
for a later one.    

Task repetition can be done not in a painful way. The solution is scripting. All the work we
do without integrating the notion of reusability is not optimal. Instead
we should always see mechanical tasks as potential scripts. It's just
because we love procrastinating and not facing the reality that we
postpone the moment we open our favourite editor and start scripting.  

Scripting is for me an important activity for many reasons. First above
all: it makes us spare a lot of time. The inputs changed? No matter, just
rerun the script and we are done.  

The second reason I love scripting is
that we produce something concrete and useful. By writing our custom
script we *"Scratch our own Stitch"*, we solve our own problem with our
own technical skills. This always provide an immense satisfaction.
Even if it took us 20 minutes, it's milestone for our path to
productivity. Coding a little script to automate a task is like shipping a
little product.  

The third reason I see is that it helps us develop and extend our programming
skills. It improves our knowledge of the scripting language, it makes us
discover API wrappers,...  

When working in a team, scripting should be even more a concern. It's
more likely that what we do our teammates would have to do it
later. What I really love in scripting for a team is that it forces us
to write good quality code because our users are our teammates. They
won't be as indulgent as we are regarding our work, we don't want them
to think how a poor coder we are, so we do it right.  


The next time we think "It would be so nice to automate this work", we
should spend some time to look for a scripting solution. The more we script the fastest we are at
doing it. So let's take some time thinking at what we are doing to
encourage our creativity and make us advance in our quest to 
productivity.
