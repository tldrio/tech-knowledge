*Roy Bahat writes a follow up to Roger and Mike's 
[article on the Hypernet](http://rogerandmike.com/post/18870279638/what-is-the-hypernet "Hypernet"). 
He explains why business development may replace SEO in the next
Internet era.*

* **Changes**
  * the iPhone changed the internet, by taking us away from the SEO-driven world of URLs and websites
  * Search won’t come first. New services succeed without ever really needing to master search (Pinterest, Angry Birds etc.)
* **New perspectives**
  * Some think social media optimization will replace search engine optimization but that's not all
  * In the next era, you can get discovered merely by having a strong relationship with one of the platforms of discovery
  * Business development may take the place of SEO.  This could be great for companies with well-known brands based on a quality service
  * That’s awful for new services with great content but no way to get an *in* – but it’s great for wonderful brands who might otherwise have struggled with the strange world of search algorithms

*Jacques Mattheij thinks about the value of Google+ for Google and why
they are pushing it so hard. This article outlines a hypothetical way in which Google+ could be of major strategic value for Google in its core business, search.*

* **The value of links is decreasing**
  * People that relied on links will now rely on Google reducing the value of links between sites 
  * People that realize that Google values links will create lots of them still further reducing the value of links between sites
  
* **Why Google is promoting Google+**
  * analytics + social network tells you what social circles are reading which articles
  * Someone that is professionally engaged in a certain field carefully studying an article in that same field is likely a good indicator that such an article is at least worthy of some notice
  * There is no algorithm as good at discriminating bad content from good content as the human mind
  * Every user in Google+ is actually now an unpaid Google employee whose actions are used to influence the google search results as a way to stop further erosion of the results due to spam
