# Conversation with Jonathan Winandy

## How We Met  

Through Benjamin Andr√© (Friend of friend of my brother). 

## Background Story

Benjamin quit Total in fall 2011 after 10 years to launch his startup. He had a very interesting
vision, very close to [here](http://lockerproject.org/ "locker"). He spoke 
to 4 people to try and put a team together, including Jonathan and I (Charles). 

At this point 
there were two people working full-time and one part-time persons. Jonathan just
quit his job and is thinking about joining them but he doesn't have the exact same vision
for the project. Benjamin is gravitates towards an application marketplace
to collect personal data whereas Jonathan is thinking more about a backbone layer to collect your existing data 
and developing some glue around it.

## Lessons Learned  

* Build your personal tree of knowledge via mind mapping tools
(Freemind) or other adapted tool. Spoke about a guy who was up and running on a
nine months old project in just two hours thanks to its knowledge
database. It strengthened my idea of capitalization via writing. I will try
to set up Freemind personally. 
* Abstraction gets you to the next level. We spoke about Bret Victor.
He is very fond of functionnal programming as you can push abstraction very far. 
* Found the setup guide project very interesting and valuable. 

## About tldr

* Like the humanism vision. 
* Very excited about it. Very intensive reader. 
* Said it was the next level of curation. 
* Spoke about monetization but that's not his primary concern. In his mind you don't pay for the data but for the service. 
* Don't over anticipate the database problems. Start with MySQL + Redisand build a minimal service as quickly as possible.
