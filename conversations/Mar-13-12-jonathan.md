# Conversation with Jonathan Winandy

## How We Met  

Through Benjamin Andr√© (Friend of friend of my brother). 

## Background Story

Benjamin quit Total last Fall after 10 years to launch a startup. He had a very interesting
vision. Same as what you can read [here](http://lockerproject.org/ "locker"). He had 
*recruited* 4 people to start with him. Jonathan and I were two of them. At this time 
there are two full time and one part time persons on the project. Jonathan just
quit and hesitates to join them as he doesn't have the exact same vision
for the project. Benjamin is more oriented on a application marketplace
to collect personal data and Jonathan on a backbone layer to collect your existing data 
and developing some glue.  

## Lessons Learned  

* Build your personal tree of knowledge via mind mapping tools
(Freemind) or other adapted tool. Spoke about a guy who was up on a
nine months old project in just two hours thanks to its knowledge
database. Strengthen my idea of capitalization via writing. I will try
to set up Freemind personaly. 
* Abstraction gets you to the next level. We spoke about Bret Victor.
Fond of functionnal programming as you can push abstraction very far. 
* Found the setup guide project very interesting and valuable. 

## About tldr

Like the humanism vision. Very excited about it. Very intensive reader. Said it was curation of
level two. Spoke about monetization but that's not his primary concern. 
You don't pay for the data but for the service. 

* Don't over anticipated the database problems. Start with MySql + Redis
and build a minimal service as quickly as possible.
