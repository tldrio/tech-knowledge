# Conversation with founder of [WatZatSong](http://www.watzatsong.com)

Watzatsong is a crowdsourced [Shazam](http://shazam.com).

## How We Met

* Breakfast
* Through Charles' brother

## Background Story

* Founded watzatsong with 2 other guys while still attending Supelec.
* Only one to ever work full-time on the project
* Got to 100,000 uniques/month but never took off, now stagnating to few hundreds uniques a day  
* Never managed to monetize properly, at best 1500euros/month with ads

## Lessons Learned

* Don't overthink engineering problems, think a lot about the UX,
  especially in engineer-only teams  
* Power-users come easily  
* Learn from your power-users and cherish them but don't listen to all
  their whims even if they blackmail you. Reward them for their work in a certain way, they are
  aware of their contribution to your success. Don't make them jealous
  or angry, they are the core of your community.  
* Removing a feature is hard so go incrementally.  
* Gamification is super important to drive a community

## About tldr
* Said idea was interesting, didn't sound overexcited though.
